Question 1

1.
firstDiv will be red and secondDiv will be orange

2.
document.getElementById(firstDiv).style.color = "pink"

3.
document.getElementById(secondDiv).classList.add("yellow-card");

Question 2

1. 
because 5 and "5" and '5' have the same values, and only differ in type

2.
use a === instead

Question 3

1.
Add conditional styling based on screen size and width
CSS already allows for this using @media style rules.

@media only screen and (max-width: 500px) {
  .hidden-on-mobile-view
	{
		display : none;
	}
}

The elements that have the class hidden-on-mobile-view will be hidden.

Bootstrap can however be used to enhance this further.

2.
Faster initial loading of the webpage

3.
install sass on your project using a package manager (yarn or npm) and use the extention scss on your stylesheets
instead of css

4.
Use a javascript compiler such as babel
